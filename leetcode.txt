Example 1:

Input: ransomNote = "a", magazine = "b"
Output: false

Example 2:

Input: ransomNote = "aa", magazine = "ab"
Output: false

Example 3:

Input: ransomNote = "aa", magazine = "aab"
Output: true


Example 4:

Input: ransomNote = "aab", magazine = "baa"
Output: true

{
  a: 2
  b:1
}

{
  a:2
  b: 1
}

Example 1:

{
  a:4
  b:4
  c:4
}
abch cba abc cba

Input: s = "aaaabbbbcccc"
Output: " abc cba abc cba"
Explanation: After steps 1, 2 and 3 of the first iteration, result = "abc"
After steps 4, 5 and 6 of the first iteration, result = "abccba"
First iteration is done. Now s = "aabbcc" and we go back to step 1
After steps 1, 2 and 3 of the second iteration, result = "abccbaabc"
After steps 4, 5 and 6 of the second iteration, result = "abccbaabccba"

Example 2:

Input: s = "rat"
Output: "art"
Explanation: The word "rat" becomes "art" after re-ordering it with the mentioned algorithm.

Example 1:

Input: s = "abcde", goal = "abcde"
Output: true

Example 2:

Input: s = "abcde", goal = "abced"
Output: false
